<p align=center> Abstract</p>
We use the relation between Drinfeld-Sokolov Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)
hierarchies and their super-extensions
and conformal field theory (CFT) in the quantization procedure.
The quantization of such models gives integrable structures for CFT,
providing the possibility to study integrable perturbations.
It appears that the
quantization can be performed successfully in the case of models
based on both (twisted) affine algebras and their super-extensions. In
this talk, basic ideas of the quantization procedure are illustrated by
two important examples: KdV hierarchies based on affine sl(2) algebra
and affine osp(2|1) superalgebra.
